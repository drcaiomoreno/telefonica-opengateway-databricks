# Open Gateway Databricks

The aim of this repo is to help developers to connect with Open Gateway APIs using Databricks and explore the data using the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.  

### What is Open Gateway?
Open Gateway is a initiative spearheaded by the GSMA in collaboration with leading telecommunications operators, cloud providers, and aggregators worldwide. Our mission is to create a standardized framework of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable simplified and universal access to cutting-edge mobile network capabilities and associated services. By leveraging Open Gateway APIs, developers can focus on building exceptional applications while we handle the complexities of network integration.
